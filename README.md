**(Educational Project)** This is a basic Deep Learning framework designed for educational purposes, helping users understand the internal workings of a DL system. The code structure is inspired by [minitorch](https://github.com/minitorch/minitorch), while the implementation details are based on the concepts taught in [LLM System 2025 Spring](https://llmsystem.github.io/llmsystem2025spring/).
